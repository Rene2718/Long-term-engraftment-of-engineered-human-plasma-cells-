# Long-term-engraftment-of-engineered-human-plasma-cells-
Due to their unique longevity and capacity to secrete high levels of protein, plasma B cells have the potential to be used as a cell therapy for protein replacement. Here, we show that ex vivo engineered human plasma cells exhibited transcriptional features of long-lived plasma cells by CITEseq single cell RNA sequecencing, and use of mathematical models to uncover the dynamic of long-lived plasma cell in vivo and the death rate dynamic in vitro.
